# CivicTechTO-TorontoBudget

## September 6, 2015

David Dou has created a [treemap](https://public.tableau.com/profile/daviddou82#!/vizhome/CityBudgetToronto/Dashboard1) of the Toronto Budget from 2003 - 2015, based on my ‘better taxonomy’ data. Super cool.

_The mission of this project is to provide a concrete assist to the Toronto Budget process which will make it easier for Toronto citizens to contribute. Specifically, provide tools to a) facilitate insight into the Toronto Budget contents, and b) provide ready access to annual budget process information, to facilitate negotiation between local actors and budget decision-makers_

This is a project organized through [civic tech toronto](http://civictech.ca/). Civic Tech meets every Tuesday to move projects forward, and all who are interested in contributing are welcome.

The current status of the Toronto Budget project is that we are reviewing project focus options, to pick one for implementation.

The current candidates are:

1. What can we do for councillors
2. Community asset utilization
3. program improvements
4. participatory budgeting - ward citizens vote on where capital budget goes
5. budget taxonomy
6. toronto budget process information portal
7. front line worker portal as ‘suggestion box’
8. bureaucracy (culture) hacks
9. illuminate citizen's mandate
10. improve budget support services

We're applying [impact mapping](http://impactmapping.org/drawing.php) (Why? Who? How? What?) to these, to establish impact and scope of each, for comparison and eventual decision purposes.

General sequence as planned: complete environment scan for budget explainer examples; consolidate our list of options; apply impact mapping on these options; bring in domain experts to help us review these options (possibly in September); select a project; enter a project development phase. Current target is to have something impactful and helpful available for the 2017 budget cycle in the fall of 2016.
