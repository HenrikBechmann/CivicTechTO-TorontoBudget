# CivicTechTO-TorontoBudget

## August 15, 2015

_The mission of this project is to provide a concrete assist to the Toronto Budget process which will make it easier for Toronto citizens to contribute._

This is a project organized through [civic tech toronto](http://civictech.ca/). Civic Tech meets every Tuesday to move projects forward, and all who are interested in contributing are welcome.

The current status of the Toronto Budget project is that we are reviewing project focus options, to pick one for implementation.

The current candidates are:

1. What can we do for councillors
2. Community asset utilization
3. program improvements
4. participatory budgeting - ward citizens vote on where capital budget goes
5. budget taxonomy
6. toronto budget process information portal
7. front line worker portal as ‘suggestion box’
8. bureaucracy (culture) hacks

We're applying [impact mapping](http://impactmapping.org/drawing.php) (Why? Who? How? What?) to these, to establish impact and scope of each, for comparison and eventual decision purposes.

For planning details see the [wiki](https://github.com/HenrikBechmann/CivicTechTO-TorontoBudget/wiki). For resource materials browse this repository.
